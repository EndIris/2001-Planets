# 2001-Planets
This mod edits the RSS planets to make them more like 2001, a Space Odyssey

-Jupiter has been deleted and replaced by the dim star Lucifer. The moons orbit Lucifer.

-Io has been heated up. There are no surface changes, however.

-Europa has totaly melted on the side facing Lucifer. This has exposed many islands in a giant sea, as well as created an atmosphere with about 40% the thickness of Earth's, but 500km high. 

-Ganymede has also begun to melt. Rivers now drain into a main equatorial lake on its near side, and an atmosphere about 4% as thick as Earth's, but 300km high.
