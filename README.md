# 2001-Planets
This mod is designed to edit the RSS planets to make them more like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and more specifically, 2061. With version 1.1.0, it is also now compatible with the stock planets and with GPP. 

In RSS:
- Jupiter has been deleted and replaced by the dim star Lucifer. The moons orbit Lucifer.
- Io has been heated up. There are no surface changes, however.
- Europa has totaly melted on the side facing Lucifer. This has exposed many islands in a giant sea, as well as created an atmosphere with about 40% the thickness of Earth's, but 500km high. 
- Ganymede has also begun to melt. Rivers now drain into a main equatorial lake on its near side, and an atmosphere about 4% as thick as Earth's, but 300km high has been created.

In Stock Games:
 - Europa is added in a solar orbit at the Lagrange point 60 degrees behind Kerbin. It is tidally locked to the sun. It and its atmosphere have been scaled down to the stock planets, but its radius and gravity have been increased so the heightmap has less tiling. 
 - Lucifer, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto have not been added.

In GPP:
 - Europa is added around Tellumo in a low-ish orbit, and is tidally locked. The melted side faces Tellumo. It and its atmosphere have been scaled down to the stock planets, but its radius and gravity have been increased so the heightmap has less tiling. 
 - Lucifer, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto have not been added.
 
# To Install
In Stock games, Kopernicus must be installed and moved into your GameData folder. Then download this mod and move the 2001_Planets folder into your GameData folder.

In GPP or RealSolarSystem games, install that mod and all of its dependencies into your GameData folder. Then download this mod and move the 2001_Planets folder into your GameData folder.

# Known Issues
 - Europa's ocean turns pink when transitioning to Scaled
 - Solar Power is way too high for Lucifer from its moons. If anyone knows how to change this please tell me!
 - Temperatures are weird, and vary wildly over 100K. Sol is to blame, don't know how to fix.
 - EVE Clouds may not cooperate well. Delete and re-install EVE if there are problems.
